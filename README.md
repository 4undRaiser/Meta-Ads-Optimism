# Summary

MetaAds provides a decentralized way of running ad campaign in the metaverse. It allows Metaverse Space owners to mint an NFT representing their space while specifying the number of daily visitors and a link pointing to their Space in the metaverse. And Users can pay a specified ammount to run a campaign for number of days selected.

# How it works

*User mints a new ad space on the metaverse as an NFT while
specifying the required parameters and paying a one time optimism public goods fee for the awesome
community :)

*Space will be automatically listed in the marketplace.

*Other users can buy these ad spaces for a specified number of
days.

*Owner of the ad space can end the campaign after the end date
has been reached and the space becomes available one again the

# Getting Started with MetaAds

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory,first run

### `npm install`

Install all required dependencies

### `npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
